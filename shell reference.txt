Quick shell scripting help:



exec bash -l or exec bash : changes current terminal shell temporarily

mv og_name.sh new_name.sh: renames script

read: is like input in python

variable=$1 : Positional parameter aka argument is the 1 coordinating with variable in script

whereami=$(pwd) : puts command to a variable

bash myscript.sh = manually runs .sh in .zsh environments 
*** though it's better to add a shebang in the beginning that looks like #!/usr/bin/env bash, then it can be ran on zsh default/environments
